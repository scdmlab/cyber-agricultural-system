I'm using Vue 3 with Vite. Use tailwind for styling whenever possible. 
After giving your code, reflect on it and see if there is discrepancy between the code and the instruction, and if
it over complicate things. Our goal is to make minimalistic and clean code, while keeping a modern, appealing UI/UX.
